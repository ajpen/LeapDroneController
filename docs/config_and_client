Config:
I can probably change the config file to accept arguments with specific names, instead of allowing
any string pair to be accepted as configuration.

Client:
I can probably pass any arguments for initializing the client via the command line arguments for the process, after
reading the arguments from the config file. With this, the application only needs to wait for some sort of signal to
know that initialization was successful.
