C++ Leap Motion -> Parrot mambo fly interfacing

The C++ application that communicates and interprets the gestures & hand positioning from the leap motion will run as the main process/program.

Workflow:

Start
1. Read configurations from file
2. Use the read configurations to initialize the Leap interface.
3. Test that connection to the Leap was successful.
4. Initialize the parrot interface with the configurations by creating the object, and attempting to start the subprocess
5. Test that the subprocess was started.

NOTE: the following steps behave as such due to the nature of the parrot interface.
6. Listen for takeoff gesture.
	a. If takeoff gesture is detected:
		i.   Attempt to connect to the parrot. If cannot connect, print diagnostic message, else print successful connection
		ii.  Attempt to takeoff. If cannot takeoff, print diagnostics. else print successful takeoff

		IN FLIGHT

		iii. While not idle (No valid movement detected by leap), send fly commands based on pitch, yaw and whatever else.
		iv.  If idle, signal a safe land and report it to the user.
		v.   If circle gesture detected, send barrel roll command in the direction of the circle.
